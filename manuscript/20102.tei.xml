<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>There is no country in the world that does not have at least one law or policy dealing with climate change. The most prolific countries have well over 20, and globally there are 1,800 such laws. Some of them are executive orders or policies issued by governments, others are legislative acts passed by parliament. The judiciary has been involved in 1,500 court cases that concern climate change (over 1,100 of which in the US). We use Climate Change Laws of the World (CCLW), a publicly accessible database, to analyze patterns and trends in climate change legislation and litigation over the past 30 years. The data reveal that global legislative activity peaked around 2009-14, well before the Paris Agreement. Accounting for effectiveness in implementation and the length of time laws have been in place, the UK and South Korea are the most comprehensive legislators among G20 countries and Spain within the OECD. Climate change legislation is less of a partisan issue than is commonly assumed: the number of climate laws passed by governments of the left, center and right is roughly proportional to their time in office. We also find that legislative activity decreases in times of economic difficulty. Where courts have got involved, judges outside the US have ruled in favor of enhanced climate protection in about half of the cases (US judges are more inclined to rule against climate protection).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The international climate change architecture commits nations to accelerate their actions on climate change. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are obliged to ratchet up their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris process in 2020. According to climate scientists, current emission reduction commitments are likely to result in a global mean temperature rise of around 3°C by 2100, rather than the "well below 2°C" envisaged under Paris <ref type="bibr">(Rogelj et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>We observe that national climate action is accelerating. <ref type="bibr">Between 1990 and</ref><ref type="bibr">1999, only</ref> 110 laws and significant policies were passed that directly or indirectly addressed climate change. Between 2010 and 2019 the flow of new laws had grown tenfold to about 1,100 laws and policies. The total stock of climate change laws and policies worldwide now stands at 1,800 and continues to grow.</p><p>Our awareness of those initiatives is improving at the same time. In 2013, climate change legislation was tracked in just 33 countries <ref type="bibr">(Townshend et al. 2013)</ref>. By 2015 the number had risen to 66 countries <ref type="bibr">(Fankhauser et al. 2015a, b)</ref>. Today coverage is global at the level of nation states. In the course of the data gathering, understanding also grew about the breadth of actions that are relevant to climate change, which brought additional laws into the count. This was the case especially for adaptation laws, where the delineation with related activities, such as disaster risk management, is necessarily fuzzy.</p><p>Climate legislation is an essential part of climate change governance, as successful action against climate change requires a legal basis. Emissions pledges are not credible unless the targets, and the measures enacted to achieve them, are rooted in law. Although climate laws and EEPE2 chapter 2, p 4 policies vary greatly in scope and ambition (that is, at the intensive margin), their growing number (the extensive margin) is an important indicator of countries' ambition on climate change.</p><p>In addition to the laws, edicts and policies passed by executive and legislative bodies, we are observing an increasing participation by the judiciary in the governance of climate change.</p><p>About 1,500 climate change-related court cases have so far been identified worldwide, three quarters of which in the United States.</p><p>The relationship between climate legislation and litigation is still unclear <ref type="bibr">(Setzer and</ref> Vanhala 2019), but broadly the two appear to serve complementary functions. The judiciary is implementing government policy prescriptions, interpreting climate legislation and filling enforcement gaps. While "regulation through litigation" can compensate for deficits in the volume or quality of legislation, the judiciary is also mobilized in countries with progressive climate change legislation. In fact, legal mobilization for climate change-using the courts and legal techniques as an instrument for obtaining wider collective objectives-often occurs combination with other forms of mobilization, such as legislative activity, but also political pressure and grassroots activism <ref type="bibr">(Setzer and Vanhala, 2019)</ref>. the objectives of the Paris Agreement. We look at the contribution of governments (the executive), parliaments (the legislature) and courts (the judiciary).</p><p>Our interest is in high-level patterns. We do not aspire to provide detailed case studies or carefully identified statistical relationships. There is an emerging literature that is aiming to do this (cited below). We restrict ourselves to a few simple statistics and correlations. The data reveal that global legislative activity peaked before the Paris Agreement in around 2009-14. We find that climate change legislation is in most countries a bipartisan concern and that legislative activity decreases in times of economic difficulty. The UK and South Korea are the most comprehensive legislators among the G20, and Spain is the most comprehensive legislator within the OECD. Where courts have got involved, judges outside the US have ruled in favor of enhanced climate protection in about half of the cases.</p><p>The next section briefly introduces the CCLW database, including its history, scope, shortcomings and a few descriptive statistics. Section 3 discusses some key findings that may be gleaned from the data. Section 4 concludes. EEPE2 chapter 2, p 6</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Background</head><p>The Climate Change Laws of the World database has been compiled over a decade with the help of international partners such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the global organization of national parliaments, and the Global Legislators Organization for a Balanced Environment (GLOBE), an international legislators' forum. The impetus for the initiative was a desire to document national climate action following the 2009 Copenhagen summit and debunk the myth that each country was acting alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Townshend et al. 2011)</ref>. Over the years, reporting grew from a handful of major emitters to global coverage. Collaboration with the Sabin Center This is the first academic synthesis of the main patterns and trends that the CCLW data reveal. So far, the data have mostly served to assess global progress in adopting climate policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dubash et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Iacobuta et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Townshend et al. 2013)</ref>, understand the political economy of passing climate laws <ref type="bibr">(Fankhauser et al. 2015a, b)</ref>, identify good practice in climate change governance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Averchenkova et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jordan et al. 2018)</ref> and assess the environmental impact of climate legislation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Eskander and Fankhauser 2020)</ref>. The litigation data have been EEPE2 chapter 2, p 7 used to assess trends in climate litigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burger et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Setzer and Bangalore 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wilensky 2015)</ref> and to analyze particular aspects of climate litigation, such as litigation in the financial sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Solana 2020)</ref> and in the Global South <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Peel and Lin 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Setzer and Benjamin 2019</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Climate change legislation</head><p>The main part of the CCLW database concerns climate change legislation. The legislation database aspires to be a globally comprehensive record of legislation activities in 198 jurisdictions (197 countries and territories, plus the European Union as a block). It adopts a broad definition of climate legislation, including legislative acts, executive orders and policies of equivalent importance. Legislative acts, passed by parliaments, account for about 40 percent of entries and executive orders and policies, issued by governments, for about 60 percent (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table   1</ref>). For simplicity, we refer to all these interventions as "laws".</p><p>The laws included in CCLW either specifically refer to climate change or promote the sectoral measures required to reduce emissions and increase climate resilience. As such, the database covers the full range of interventions that is relevant to climate change, including:</p><p>• overarching policies like carbon pricing schemes (e.g., New Zealand's Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment),</p><p>• energy sector policies (e.g., Germany's Renewable Energy Sources Act),</p><p>• transport interventions (e.g., Brazil's Mandatory Biodiesel Requirements),</p><p>• forestry interventions as relate to climate (e.g., the Democratic Republic of Congo's Law on Protection of the Nature), and</p><p>• adaptation interventions (e.g., Japan's Climate Change Adaptation Act).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EEPE2 chapter 2, p 8</head><p>A particularly important category is strategic framework laws, which aim to create a unifying institutional structure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or address physical climate risks, or often both. An instructive example is the UK Climate Change <ref type="bibr">Act of 2008, which (i)</ref> sets a legally binding long-term mitigation goal (since strengthened to net-zero by 2050), (ii) legislates intermediary short-term targets (or carbon budgets), (iii) creates an independent advisory body (the Committee on Climate Change), (iv) establishes a continual process of adaptation planning, and (v) mandates regular government reporting on progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Averchenkova et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Muinzer 2018</ref> However, the majority of climate laws concern sector-specific interventions, in particular on energy. About 60 percent of laws contain provisions on energy supply, such as the promotion of renewable energy, and / or energy demand, such as industrial or residential energy efficiency.</p><p>Interventions on transport and forestry are less frequent. About a third of all laws concern climate resilience and adaptation to climate risks. CCLW now also covers disaster risk management, that is, laws concerned with the impacts of current climate variability, rather than future climate change.</p><p>Insert <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1 here (Descriptive legislation statistics)</ref> EEPE2 chapter 2, p 9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Climate change litigation</head><p>The litigation database within CCLW is different from the legislation database in that it does not aspire to be comprehensive in its geographic coverage or in the number of cases it contains.</p><p>CCLW adopts a broad definition of litigation in terms of actors (governmental and nongovernmental), jurisdictional levels (local, regional, national and international) and the profile of the case (climate as central or peripheral). Included in the database are lawsuits brought before administrative, judicial and other investigatory bodies that raise issues of law or fact regarding the science of climate change and climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Markell and Ruhl 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burger et al. 2017)</ref>. The case files contain keywords such as climate change, global warming, global change, greenhouse gas, GHGs, and sea level rise. Cases that make only passing reference to the fact of climate change, its causes or its effects are excluded if they do not address in direct or meaningful fashion the laws, policies or actions that compel, support or facilitate climate mitigation or adaptation. Cases that seek incidentally to accomplish (or prevent) climate change policy goals without reference to climate change issues are not included <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burger et al. 2017)</ref>. Thus, for example, the database does not include cases in which the parties seek to limit air pollution from coal-fired power plants but do not directly raise issues of fact or law pertaining to climate change.</p><p>The identification of climate change litigation also involves characterizing the centrality of climate change issues to the case <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Peel and Osofsky 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bouwer 2018)</ref>. Climate change can range from being a central issue in a case, to peripheral, that is, litigation that was brought in part over climate change issues but focuses on other grounds (for example, disputes over the siting of wind farms or about subsidies for renewable energy). Litigation that is not explicitly tied EEPE2 chapter 2, p 10 to climate change arguments but is within the context of climate change (for instance, disputes relating to insurance and risk, or intellectual property rights) has been underappreciated by the literature, but has important strategic, policy and governance implications because it could implicitly impact on accessibility of finance or new technologies to support climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bouwer 2018</ref> Over 80 percent of the non-US cases have been brought against governments, and typically the plaintiff is either a private company or a non-governmental organization (NGO).</p><p>Lawsuits against private defendants are still relatively rare <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 2</ref>; see also Wilensky 2015).</p><p>Most cases are routine and concern the application, interpretation and enforcement of laws such as planning law or the operation of emissions trading schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Markell and Ruhl 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bouwer 2018</ref>).</p><p>Climate change is at the core of the legal argument in less than 40 per cent of cases (138 out of 355). A smaller number of these lawsuits can be described as strategic cases. The delineation is not firm, but these are high-profile claims brought either against governments, EEPE2 chapter 2, p 11 where plaintiffs seek increased mitigation ambition, or against large emitters, where plaintiffs seek compensation for damages caused by, or costs incurred due to, climate change. Their aim is to advance policy outcomes and to drive behavioral shifts by key actors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Peel and Osofsky 2015)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Limitations</head><p>While CCLW is arguably the most comprehensive database of its kind, it has some limitations. In terms of legislation data, an important issue is that the database is silent about the quality of different laws. Stringent and comprehensive framework laws like the UK Climate Change Act, which has been praised for its innovative features <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Averchenkova et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Muinzer 2018)</ref>, are treated in the same way as unsuccessful laws such as Indonesia's various attempts to combat deforestation.</p><p>The delineation of what does and does not constitute a climate change law can be difficult. Although CCLW errs on the side of inclusion, by restricting the collection to certain categories of climate-related laws and policies, the dataset presents an incomplete picture of regulatory efforts relating to climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Scotford and Minas 2019)</ref>. The issue is perhaps most pertinent in the areas of adaptation and land-use change, but similar definitional issues also affect the litigation database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EEPE2 chapter 2, p 12</head><p>The legislation database focuses on national climate policy, which means initiatives at the sub-national level and by non-state actors are not covered. State, province and city-led initiatives are particularly significant in countries with federal structures or where national engagement with climate change has been intermittent, such as Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United States. In each of these countries, climate policy at sub-national level is fairly advanced and often ahead of the national discourse.</p><p>Conversely, in EU member states a focus on national climate policy would ignore the important role of the European Union in national climate policy. The EU has passed 33 climate laws, including legislation to set up an EU-wide emissions trading scheme and establish ambitious targets on renewable energy, which are legally binding for its member states.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a relatively easy fix to this bias, which is to add all EU laws to the tally of member states <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Eskander and Fankhauser 2020)</ref>.</p><p>A potential problem for time series or panel data analysis is that when laws are amended the database only records the latest version, thus omitting earlier activities. Legal provisions are often tightened over time (as for example Switzerland did when revising its CO2 Act in 2013), but there are also cases of reversal (such as the repeal of Canada's Kyoto Implementation Act in 2012 and Australia's Clean Energy Act in 2014). In each case, these events supersede earlier database entries.</p><p>The litigation dataset has its own limitations. Perhaps the most important one concerns data collection. While the CCLW dataset is the largest one compiled to date, it cannot be deemed representative or comprehensive. Rather, the dataset consists of cases from a limited number of countries, dictated by data accessibility and language considerations. The case list heavily relies on partners of the data providers and on media reports, predominantly in English-ultimately EEPE2 chapter 2, p 13 meaning we cannot be sure of the full extent of unidentified litigation cases. Moreover, due to different regulation and litigation cultures, the database is highly uneven, with the majority of the cases attributable to a few jurisdictions. Finally, the CCLW dataset does not include litigation in the US, where the majority of cases has been brought and where, due to relative advantages in procuring information about the cases, the data is closer to being comprehensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Insights</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The peak in climate change legislation predates the Paris Agreement</head><p>Practically all climate change laws have been passed over the last 30 years ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 1</ref>). In 1990, there were only 35 laws with relevance to climate change worldwide <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 1 above</ref> non-Annex 1 (developing) countries in the aftermath of the Kyoto Protocol, which imposed binding obligations on the former. However, the effect was temporary and relatively small.</p><p>The impact of the Paris Agreement appears equally limited. The peak in legislative activity clearly pre-dates the Agreement, which was signed in December 2015. Only about 230 EEPE2 chapter 2, p 15 climate-relevant laws were passed in the subsequent four years, which is less than half the annual rate than during the peak years.</p><p>The more significant impact of the Paris Agreement was perhaps on the ambition of new laws (the intensive margin), rather than their number (the extensive margin). Several countries, including Sweden (2017), France (2019), New Zealand (2019) and the UK (2019) have passed acts to put into law an economy-wide net-zero emissions target (that is, a balance between emissions and their removal from the atmosphere) in line with the Paris objectives. However, analysis has shown that very few of the emissions pledges contained in countries' NDCs are matched by legislated national emissions targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nachmany and Mangan 2018)</ref>. The legislative implementation of the Paris Agreement is still far from complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Spain, the UK and South Korea are the most comprehensive legislators</head><p>Every country in the world now has at least one climate law, as defined by CCLW, and in some jurisdictions the number is well over 20 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 3a</ref>). The median country has passed eight climate change laws and policies <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 1)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insert Figure 3 here (Map of climate legislation and litigation by countries)</head><p>The number of climate laws a country has passed tells us something about the interest of its law makers in climate change. However, it is not a perfect indicator of climate action. Simply counting the number of laws ignores the considerable heterogeneity that exists in countries' legislative approaches to climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Averchenkova et al. 2017</ref> Bearing this caveat in mind, we calculate three statistics that we believe are informative about countries' determination to act on climate change. The first indicator is the number of laws that were on the statute book (or more accurately, in the CCLW database) by the end of 2019.</p><p>The second indicator accounts for government effectiveness. The presumption is that laws passed by effective governments are more likely to be implemented, and therefore have a higher real-world impact, than those passed by ineffectual governments. Our effectiveness indicator is the Rule of Law variable from the Worldwide Governance Indicators by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kaufman et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>The variable captures "perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the court" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kaufman et al. 2010</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">8</ref> The third indicator factors in the date when a law was passed, by calculating the number of law-years in a country. For example, the UK Climate Change Act, which was passed in 2008 has a weight of 12. The presumption is that laws that were passed early on have had a longer and therefore bigger impact on climate policy. Law-years are again weighted by the level of government effectiveness to account for differences in implementation. <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 4</ref> reports the top and bottom five performers among three (overlapping) sets of countries, the G20 group of leading economies, the member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the member states of the European Union during the period of interest. The full set of results can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Appendix Table A1</ref>.</p><p>The three indicators lead to very consistent results, with rank correlations of 0.88 or more between them. However, for individual countries there can be interesting deviations, related to EEPE2 chapter 2, p 17 the effectiveness with which laws are implemented. European countries like Spain, Italy and the UK are among the most prolific legislators, with over 20 laws each (not counting EU-level laws, which also apply to member states). Spain and the UK, and to a lesser extent Italy also score well in the other two indicators, as European countries tend to have relatively effective governments and many of their climate laws are several years old. However, government effectiveness makes a difference in Brazil and Indonesia. Both countries are in the top-five G20 countries in terms of number of laws, but controlling for government effectiveness and law-years, the best G20 performers are the UK and South Korea.</p><p>Insert <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 4</ref> here (Country-law statistics)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Climate legislation is less of a partisan issue than commonly assumed</head><p>A striking feature of the climate change debate, particularly in anglophone countries like Australia, Canada and the United States, is the strong party-political divide. There is evidence that left-of-center governments are generally more inclined to legislate on the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Neumayer 2003)</ref>, but the issue appears particularly pronounced for climate change, where we observe a notable undercurrent of climate skepticism on the political right (McCright and Dunlap 2011a, b; and Painter and Ashe 2012). However, the effect of party politics on environmental policy is complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carter et al. 2018)</ref>, and it has also been suggested that that right-wing climate skepticism may primarily be an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fankhauser et al. 2015a</ref>). There may also be a gender dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mavisakalyan and Tarverdi 2019)</ref>.</p><p>To shed more light on this debate we look at climate change legislation in the democratic countries of the sample, defined as countries with a democracy score of 6 or more in the Polity IV dataset (a standard measure of democratic quality). 9 For each of these countries we calculate EEPE2 chapter 2, p 18 the fraction of climate change laws that was passed by administrations of a particular political orientation (right, left or center), divided by the share of years they have been in power.</p><p>Algebraically, the indicator for partisanship has the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= ⁄ ⁄ ( )</formula><p>where, denotes number of laws passed, denotes years in power and subscript denotes political orientation, = { , ℎ , }. Data on party-political orientation was taken from the World Bank's Database of Political Institutions (DPI). 10</p><p>The indicator has a straightforward interpretation: A score greater than one suggests that governments of political persuasion are disproportionately inclined to pass climate change legislation. Their share of climate laws is greater than their relative time in power. A score less than one suggests a comparative reluctance to legislate on climate change.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table A2</ref>. We would expect the distribution for the right-wing index to be to the left of one (i.e., most countries score less than one) and those for left and center parties to be to the right of one. However, this is not what we find. For most distributions we cannot reject the hypothesis that their mean is equal to one ( Insert <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> here (Histogram of political orientation scores)</p><p>Insert <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> here (Statistical tests of political orientation)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Climate legislation slows during difficult economic times</head><p>Climate change requires persistent policy intervention over decades and as such it should cut across the business cycle.

We are therefore interested in the extent to which judges rule against or in favor of tighter climate action. CCLW contains this information for most cases where a ruling has been issued.</p><p>The way judges rule is particularly material in the case of strategic court cases (such as those in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3)</ref> To inform this issue, court rulings have been classified as either strengthening climate action or weakening climate action. The distinction is similar to another classification found in the literature, which splits court cases into "pro" and "anti" regulatory suits, depending on the aims of the plaintiffs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Markell and Ruhl 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hilson 2012)</ref>. "Pro" (also known as "favorable") cases are brought with the objective of increasing regulation or liability associated with climate change; and "anti" (also known as "con" or "hindering") cases aim to decrease regulation or liability <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Wilensky 2015)</ref>. However, here we are interested in the ruling of the judge, rather than the objective of the plaintiff.</p><p>In the United States, an earlier analysis of cases brought between 1990 and 2016 found that outcomes favored anti-regulatory litigants compared with pro-regulatory litigants by a ratio of 1.4 to 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McCormick et al. 2018)</ref>. We re-examined 534 of these cases and found that judges EEPE2 chapter 2, p 22 ruled in favor of more climate regulation in 225 (42%) of them <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 7)</ref>. Examined by topic, pro-regulation litigants have tended to win renewable energy and energy efficiency cases, but frequently lost coal-fired power plant cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McCormick et al. 2018</ref>). This win ratio seems to have been enough to shape some policy outcomes. According to Osofsky (2012) climate litigation has brought about credible steps to increase the share of renewable energy in the US electricity mix.</p><p>Outside the United States, judges appear more inclined to support climate action. There are 355 non-US court cases where a judgement has been reached and the climate change outcome has been assessed. Among these, the ruling has been supportive of climate change action in 187 cases, or about half of the time ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 7)</ref>. The number is slightly lower than in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Setzer and Byrnes (2019)</ref>, who found that judges favored pro-regulatory litigants over antiregulatory litigants by a ratio of 1.6 to 1. In Australia, the country with the highest number of cases outside the US, these court rulings have apparently been instrumental in forcing administrative decision-makers to consider climate change impacts in the approval of certain large-scale projects (Preston 2011; Peel 2011; Hughes 2019).</p><p>Insert 4 Full text and summary available at: https://climate-laws.org/cclow/geographies/unitedkingdom/laws/climate-change-act-34405aa9-396e-4a78-a662-20cad9696365.</p><p>5 Full text and summary available at: https://climatelaws.org/cclow/geographies/mexico/laws/general-law-on-climate-change.

As there was little awareness of the climate issue at that time, most of these laws had related objectives such as energy efficiency (e.g. Costa Rica's Energy Law 1990). Other early laws had wider environmental objectives that were later applied to climate change. For example, the US Clean Air Act 1963 is concerned with air pollution, but after a 2007 ruling by the Supreme Court (Massachusetts vs Environmental Protection Agency), the Obama administration used it as the legal basis to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Insert Figure 1 here (Climate change legislation over time) By the mid-1990s the number of climate laws began to rise. Prominent early examples are Sweden's Carbon Tax Act 1991 and Japan's Act on Promotion of Global Warming Counter Measures 1998. Law making reached a peak in the period 2009-14, when over 120 new laws were passed each year. During this heyday, significant framework laws were passed for example in the UK (2008), South Korea (2010) and Mexico (2012). The European Union's 2020 Climate and Energy Package with its 20-20-20 targets (for emissions, renewable energy and energy EEPE2 chapter 2, p 14 efficiency) was also passed in this period. In the United States, a law of similar standing, the American Clean Energy and Securities Act 2009, known as the Waxman-Markey Bill after its sponsors, was approved by the House of Representatives, but not tabled in the Senate. After 2014, legislative activity began to tail off. The 2009-14 peak was supported by increased activity in developing countries, sometimes with the support of development agencies. Many of these interventions concerned adaptation, which was a bigger legislative focus than in the industrialized world. Most of them were policy documents, such as Ethiopia's Climate-resilient Green Growth Strategy 2011. Legislative acts passed by parliament are much rarer (Table 1 above), although there are notable exceptions such as Kenya's Climate Change Act of 2016. Climate change litigation cases peaked at around the same time, although the rise was more sudden, with very few cases before the mid-2000s (Figure 2). Litigation was spearheaded in industrialized countries (EU and OECD member states, including the US), with a much slower ramp up of cases elsewhere. Insert Figure 2 here (Climate change litigation over time) It is difficult to discern an impact of external factors, such as the international climate negotiations, on national climate legislation or litigation.

In December 2019, the Dutch Supreme Court upheld earlier rulings, which required the Netherlands to reduce its emissions by at least 25 percent on 1990 levels by 2020. Even before the final decision by the Supreme Court, the case triggered substantial changes in government policy, including the adoption of the Climate Act 2019 and the decision to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2030 (Verschuuren 2019; Jodoin et al. 2018). The case motivated a wave of Urgenda-inspired climate change litigation across the world. 2012 and the Framework for Implementation of Climate Change Policy (2014-2030). The court, citing domestic and international legal principles, determined that "the delay and lethargy of the State in implementing the Framework offend the fundamental rights of the citizens." plaintiffs led by Greenpeace Southeast Asia filed a petition asking the Philippines Commission on Human Rights to investigate "the human rights implications of climate change and ocean acidification and the resulting rights violations in the Philippines", and "whether the investor-owned Carbon Majors have breached their responsibilities to respect the rights of the Filipino people." The Commission found that fossil fuel companies have a clear moral responsibility, and the onus falls on individual countries to pass strong legislation and establish legal liability in their courts. The Commission further found that in the Philippines provided grounds for action, and that it may be possible to hold companies criminally accountable where they have been clearly proved to have engaged in acts of obstruction and willful obfuscation.</figDesc></figure>

In industrialized countries (OECD and European Union members), and for all countries in the case of legislative acts, there is no statistical evidence that the number of climate laws passed by governments of the left, center and right is not proportional to their time in office. Only in the case of executive orders issued by EEPE2 chapter 2, p 19 governments outside the OECD / EU does the political right appear to be less inclined to act on climate change.Although we do not control for confounding factors, this suggests that the task of passing climate change legislation is less of partisan issue than the public debate in countries like the Australia, Canada and United States would make us believe.Of course, indicators like equation (1) mask important political dynamics, and the leftright divide does not always mirror a divide on environmental matters<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Carter 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carter et al.</ref> </figDesc><table /><note>2018). The UK, for example, has a low right-wing party score of 0.6 (AppendixTable A2), butclimate policy has mostly transcended party lines. The opposition Conservatives supported many of the laws put forward by Labour governments, most notably the Climate Change Act 2008. The US score of 1.3 reflects the fact that the legislative and executive are often controlled by different parties.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_5"><head>Table 7</head><label>7</label><figDesc>CCLW documents the explosion of national climate change legislation over this period, although global action on climate change still falls short of what the Paris Agreement requires.By the end of 2019, the database contained 1,800 climate change laws and policies of similar status worldwide, compared with 35 laws in 1990 and 145 laws in 1999. Only about 40 percent of these laws are legislative acts passed by parliaments. The remainder are executive orders, decrees or significant policies issued by governments. that are consistent with the Paris objectives. However, most of the emissions pledges contained in NDCs have yet to be translated into legislated targets.Without going into careful statistical identification, the data reveal some interesting and perhaps surprising patterns. We find that climate change legislation is much less of partisan issue worldwide than the debate in countries like the Australia, Canada and United States would suggest. In industrialized countries (OECD plus European Union members), the number of climate laws passed by governments of the left, center and right is proportional to their time in office. Only in democracies outside this group is the political right less inclined to legislate on climate change.We further find that legislative activity fluctuates with the business cycle and slows down in times of economic difficulty. This is despite the fact that the peak in climate change legislation coincided with the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. It suggests that the pace of climate action may decline in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.CCLW has so far mainly been aimed at policy audiences, where it has helped to build trust among international policy makers and support legislators in drafting their own climate laws. It is only now starting to be utilized in academic research. Initial applications have used the data to assess global progress in adopting climate policies, understand the political economy of passing climate laws, identify good practice in climate change governance, assess the environmental impact of climate legislation, and identify general trends in climate litigation. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate other scholars to use the data in their own research.
